Calorie++ is an app made for beginner-friendly gym rats who are starting out and are wanting to track their calories. The UI of the app is intended to be easy to work with and to track calories with.
It uses java.Swing library for the GUI aspect of the project, and contains all of the user's data stored in an SQL Database. Through the combination of object-oriented programming as well as the features provided by the powerful java.Swing library, this project was able to provide the user a unique and fair experience.

# Tests
- This project was not tested that often due to the fact that it was a semester long project. The final version of this project (up to date) could not be further modified and thus the product remains in the same state as it was before the project deadline.

# Future Implementations
- Through .JSP
- Information stores to database
